# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple hour-by-hour planner for an 8 am - 6 pm workday. It pushed my day.js skills and also showed me how much I have to learn about maniuplating js objects, jquery objects, and node lists. I had ran into many issues trying to run jquery methods, and ended up using vanilla js, maybe entirely. In the end, it wasn't a lot of code, but it was a lot of thinking and reading documentation about how to achieve the desired functionality.

## Usage

This was built based on the following acceptance criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
